title: "Zeroth Sprint Project"
description: "This is the introduction to the Zeroth Sprint Project"
---

Zeroth Sprint is a project that has the main objective of being a platform to
try new ideias and concepts in a real world like environment. Here I'll create
projects and write about the project management, design, development and
deployment of these kinds of tools

This is in it's essence a passion project, so the main goal is to have fun and
learn new things. Don't expect 100% consistency in cadence of posting.

This first project is the actual zeroth sprint project directory. And this posts
are going out whilst the actual platform is being built. While we are in this process,
things will change and evolve. The codebase is _open source_ and you can find the repo
[on github](https://github.com/ygor-the-monster/zeroth), there is no real CI/CD
pipeline yet so the latest deployment might not match the latest commit.

There are already some considerations that were done before even beginning zeroth. I'll 
go over all of them in a this project and as I update / get this deployed. Which means
not even this post is in it's final form yet.

As I am Brazilian, this is also a bilingual project. I'll be sure to write in
both Portuguese and English. This is not machine translated at all, so bear in
mind there might be some differences and some out of sync writting.
