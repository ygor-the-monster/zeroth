description: "Even if it's not a big-ish project, it's still a big-ish project"

When I started this project, I had a few ideas in mind. I wanted to create a
platform to try new ideias. I also wanted to revive old projects that maybe
never had the chance to see the light of day. That means I had to set myself up
for success from the start here.

Ever since I started coding my knowledge of project management has been the
limiting factor to many new ideias. For *zeroth* I might've overkilled it but I
set out to always structure projects into a "sprint"-like structure. this means
creating tasks, categorizing them and putting them up in a board. This will help
to track progress and to also have a better overview of each project.

That meant architecting a project organization structure that would be flexible
eno enough to handle all kinds of things I wanted to throw at it. So first thing
is defining a task.

## What is a task?

> ***task*** | *noun, singular* <br />
> A piece of work to be done or undertaken.

For us it can be boiled down to a small enough piece of work so that my tiny
attention span can complete it, before I get bored and move on to something
else.

This means that a task cannot be something big like "building a full blog
platform". In practical terms I'll define a task the same way I define an item
in a to-do list.

An important thing here is to remember that there are many different types of
tasks, for example, designing and coding are two very different types of tasks
with different approaches.

In the end I decided to have each task have three main attributes:

- **Description**: What is this about?
- **Type**: What kind of task is this?
- **Blockers**: What needs to be done before this task can be started?

This means that a task can be something like **"Design the home page"** or **"Build
the home page"**. The type can be something like **"Design"** or **"Code"**. And the
blockers point to other tasks for example **"Build the home page"** needs **"Design
the home page"** to be completed first.

A task will also always have a progress, 100% means all the steps needed to get
this working are done, but keep in mind that the task might change during it's
progress. For example, a design task will become a coding task eventually.

## The task board

Finally, we get to the task board. This is the main place where all tasks are
organized. There are planty of apps that could do this but I wanted to show the
task board on the projects so I had to build it myself.

Since I'm building the task board myself there are a few things I would like to see in it:

- **Color coding**: I want to be able to color code tasks based on their type.
- **Progress tracking**: I want to be able to see the progress of each task.
- **Task dependencies**: I want to be able to see the dependencies of each task.
- **Task History**: I want to be able to see when a task was created, updated and completed.

As I said before this is being built as I write so technically this is post in
itself is spawning a task for that task board. So I'll start using a proto-board
to keep track of it.
